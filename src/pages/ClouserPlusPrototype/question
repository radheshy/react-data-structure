ðŸš€ Question

You are asked to build a small React app that demonstrates:

Prototypes:
Create a User constructor function with prototype methods getFullName() and getEmail().
Use it to generate a list of users and display them in the UI.

Closures:
Add a button for each user that increments their personal "click counter".
Use a closure to maintain each userâ€™s counter, so the count persists between clicks without storing it in React state.

Event Bubbling:
Create a parent <div> that listens for click events on all user items using event bubbling.
When a user item is clicked, log the id of that user to the console via the parent handler (not on the child).

Expected Flow:

On page load, render a list of users from your prototype.

Each user has:

Full name (from prototype).

Email (from prototype).

A button that shows "Clicked X times" (count stored via closure).

Clicking on the userâ€™s area triggers the parent divâ€™s event bubbling handler.

ðŸŽ¯ Interview Evaluation Criteria

Prototypes: Did you attach methods to the prototype instead of defining them inside the constructor?

Closures: Is the counter stored without relying on React state?

Event Bubbling: Is the parent capturing child clicks properly?
